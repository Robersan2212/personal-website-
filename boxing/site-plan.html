        Content

      <p>
        [•	(Introduction to Page) My website will intent to be a platform where new starting boxing fans and long deep in experience boxers can come to learn the best boxing advice for their training. I will break down this website in different sections where they user would be able to learn about the basics of boxing to very advance moves that thy can apply to their routines. I will also include monthly advice from a recent fight that could help them improve their technique, physical strength, and diet. I think it is also very important to include dietary advice to help them improve their stamina and physical condition in the ring. I also thought on maybe including some workout routines that will relate to their technique improvement and strength. 
        •	(Gear) On a different section I would like to add one dedicated to gear that can be convenient for the user to start with, as well to the highest quality gear that a boxer can dream of. I will review these products on certain aspects, and I will include my personal opinion on what my preferences are and how I started with. I think this will provide the user with more specific direction on where they should spend their money on, so they don’t waste time trying out low quality products that can cause them injuries. 
        •	(Safety) On a separate section, I would like to add a section for safety techniques to avoid injuries from the way that they should wrap the hands, to the way that they should take a punch. I will be very extending and specific with this section on my website. I could include a list of inexpensive products that they could purchase to improve their safety and reduce the risk of an injury, I thought on having this section as one in the top of my menu list. I thought on having a side bar menu with all these section beside my header menu.
        •	(Motivation) On a different section I will create a motivational page. I will base this page on motivational quotes that I could get from the world champions or boxing experts. I could suggest readings, like books or other pages that focus on this part. I thought on also adding motivational video form YouTube, I will figure out and investigate more about what will implied with copyright, but I think this could be very helpful for the user to have. Under this section I thought on recommending movies as well that are boxing related. Maybe I could break down each category of content in this website. 
        •	(News) In this section I thought on including a section for news in the sport. I would not dive as much into this section and be very detailed. I thought on focusing on the main events in the most popular weight classes. I think for the new users that are getting into the sport, it will be very helpful so they can see the best fights in the industry, and so they can develop a passion for the sport. I thought on maybe having a post-fight section where I could do an analysis of the fight and bring some learning material for the user. 
        •	(About My Page) On my last section I thought on having a description about what the page is about, so it can be used as a guide to navigate the website properly and the user can get the most out of the page. I think it can be an overall overview of what the page can offer, and maybe I can have in this page a contact section with my email, for any request or suggestions on how to improve the website. I could also post a comment section that can be public in the page.
